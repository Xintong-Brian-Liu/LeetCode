Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. 
You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

Input = nums = [3,2,3]
Output = 3

Brute Force:
Use two loops to iterate the array, and if the count is bigger then len(nums) // 2
We can return the num
