Approach 1: Brute Force 
We can iterate all the list, and put them into one list, and sort it. 
We insert the sorted list into the LinkedList 
class Solution:
    def mergeKLists(self, lists: List[ListNode]) -> ListNode:
        temp_list = []
        head = curr = ListNode(0)
        for linkedList in lists:
            while linkedList:
                temp_list.append(linkedList.val)
                linkedList = linkedList.next
        for num in sorted(temp_list):
            curr.next = ListNode(num)
            curr = curr.next 
        return head.next
